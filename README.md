#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

### Specification

As always, begin by downloading the ZIP file or by cloning this repo.

### How do I open this app?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `py -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` This will open the main page with the restaurant overview, a map of the area, filter options and short descriptions of the restaurants.

3. Click on "View Details" to find more information about each restaurant, like hours of operation as well as some reviews, maybe written by former guests of these restaurants, maybe written by Udacity staff (which does not necessarily mean they have never been to these restaurants, maybe they were former guests AND they work at Udacity? We will never know).
